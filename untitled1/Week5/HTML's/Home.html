<h1>MONSTER HUNTER</h1>
    <p style=" float: left">
Monster Hunter: World[a] is an action role-playing game developed<br>
and published by Capcom. A part of the Monster Hunter series,<br>
it was released worldwide for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One in January 2018,<br>
with a Microsoft Windows version being scheduled later in the year.<br>
In the game, the player takes the role of a Hunter, <br>
tasked to hunt down and either kill or trap monsters<br>
that roam in one of several environmental spaces. <br>
If successful, the player is rewarded through loot<br>
consisting of parts from the monster and other elements<br>
that are used to craft weapons and armor, <br>
among other equipment. The game's core loop <br>
has the player crafting appropriate gear to be able to hunt down<br>
more difficult monsters, which in turn provide <br>
parts that lead to more powerful gear.<br>
Players may hunt alone, or can hunt in cooperative groups of <br>
up to four players via the game's online services.</p>
